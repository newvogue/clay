# Clay

Your own trading workspace. Signals, review, and control.

## Current Status

This repository is the implementation workspace for `Clay`.

At the moment:

- the architecture and planning phase are complete;
- implementation starts here;
- the first delivery target is `Wave 1`:
- `E1` runtime foundation
- `E2` data ingestion and local historical store
- `E3` trading workspace and live signal surface
- `E4` control center and runtime operations
- `E5` AI roles, orchestration, and model assignment
- `E6` signal lifecycle, ranking, and risk-control
- `E7` session lifecycle, briefing, pause, and pair replacement
- `E8` demo trading integration and result tracking
- `E9` audit trail, feedback, and session review
- `E10` knowledge base and research layer
- `E11` backtesting, replay, and model/strategy activation

- `GET /signals/overview` for the current evaluated signal bundle;
- risk triggers for stale data, thin context, AI conflicts, runtime degradation, and expired decision windows;
- `Trading Workspace` wired to signal-engine truth instead of inline heuristic ranking;
- frontend risk/signal panels that now expose confidence penalties, response actions, strategy mode, and visible triggers.

## E7 Progress

## Repository Layout

- `backend/` — future backend application and runtime services
- `frontend/` — future web UI application
- `docs/planning/` — imported planning source documents needed during implementation
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for local development and repo automation

## Planning Source

The most important planning references live in `docs/planning/`:

- `blueprint-v1.md`
- `tech-stack-v1.md`
- `execution-backlog-v1.md`
- `master-planning-review-v1.md`

Implementation should follow those documents rather than reinvent system boundaries during coding.

## Bootstrap Commands

Backend:

```bash
make backend-install
make backend-test
make backend-run
cd backend && uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Frontend:

```bash
make frontend-install
make frontend-test
make frontend-build
make frontend-run
```

## Local Environment

Copy `.env.example` if you want to override defaults for local development.

- `CLAY_API_HOST` and `CLAY_API_PORT` define the backend bind address.
- `CLAY_DATABASE_URL` defines the PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB connection used by `E2`.
- `VITE_CLAY_API_BASE_URL` defines which backend URL the frontend shell calls.

## E2 Notes

- `E2` expects PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB available before running real migrations.
- test coverage uses SQLite with schema translation, while runtime remains targeted at PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB.
- Current `E2` routes:
  - `GET /ingestion/health`
  - `POST /ingestion/run`
  - `GET /market-data/bars/latest`
  - `GET /context-data/summary`
  - `GET /shortlist/metrics`

## E4 Notes

- `Control Center` is intentionally operator-facing and not a substitute for the future `Trading Workspace`.
- Current `E4` routes:
  - `GET /control-center/overview`
  - `GET /control-center/stream`
- operator commands still flow through the existing runtime, services, configs, and ingestion endpoints.

## E3 Notes

- `Trading Workspace` is the analyst-facing layer and intentionally separate from `Control Center`.
- Current `E3` routes:
  - `GET /workspace/trading`
  - `GET /workspace/trading/focus`
  - `POST /workspace/trading/focus`
  - `GET /workspace/trading/stream`
- current focus logic is derived from persisted `E2` data and current control-plane state; no browser-side market/provider calls are used.

## E5 Notes

- `AI Control` is the operator-facing orchestration layer for roles and model assignments, not a hidden auto-router.
- Current `E5` routes:
  - `GET /ai-control/overview`
  - `POST /ai-control/assignments/review`
  - `POST /ai-control/assignments/apply`
  - `GET /ai-control/stream`
- assignment changes require an explicit review/apply flow; silent switching is intentionally blocked by design.

## E6 Notes

- `signal_engine` is the source of truth for signal state, ranking, and risk semantics.
- Current `E6` routes:
  - `GET /signals/overview`
- `Trading Workspace` consumes evaluated signal truth from the backend instead of inventing ranking/risk behavior in the UI layer.

## E7 Notes

- `session_control` is the discipline layer for starting, pausing, resuming, reviewing, and completing a session.
- Current `E7` routes:
  - `GET /session/overview`
  - `POST /session/start`
  - `POST /session/pause`
  - `POST /session/resume`
  - `POST /session/complete`
  - `POST /session/replacement/review`
  - `POST /session/replacement/apply`
  - `GET /session/stream`
- session transitions stay explicit and operator-confirmed; pair replacement cannot happen silently.

## E8 Notes

- `Demo Validation` is still manual-first: the operator executes trades externally and `Clay` records the intent/result relationship.
- Current `E8` routes:
  - `GET /demo-trading/overview`
  - `POST /demo-trading/log-current`
  - `POST /demo-trading/results/ingest`
  - `GET /demo-trading/stream`
- the readiness gate stays conservative: fewer than five sessions keeps the stage in `collecting`, while unresolved or mismatched records keep it `at_risk`.

## E9 Notes

- `Session Review` turns demo evidence into an operator-facing review loop instead of leaving it as raw logs.
- Current `E9` routes:
  - `GET /session-review/overview`
  - `POST /session-review/feedback`
  - `GET /session-review/stream`
- AI-assisted review stays advisory only; strategy/model changes still require explicit confirmation.

## E10 Notes

- `Knowledge Base` in `v1` is a light mode for notes, strategy rules, checklists, and observations.
- Current `E10` routes:
  - `GET /knowledge/overview`
  - `POST /knowledge/items`
  - `GET /knowledge/stream`
- retrieval is intentionally advisory and must not block signal ranking, session start, or demo validation flows.

## E11 Notes

- `Validation Lab` is the staged validation layer between observed behavior and any strategy/model activation.
- Current `E11` routes:
  - `GET /validation-lab/overview`
  - `POST /validation-lab/runs`
  - `POST /validation-lab/activation/review`
  - `POST /validation-lab/activation/apply`
  - `GET /validation-lab/stream`
- activation remains explicit and operator-confirmed; replay evidence can return `ready`, `staged`, or `blocked` posture before apply.
