"""Clay scheduler — APScheduler wrapper for non-request background work.

B3a introduced the scaffold (``start()`` / ``shutdown(wait=True)`` plus
a real ``session-scheduler`` status replacing the pre-B3 fake
``HEALTHY`` stamp in ``bootstrap.py``). B3b adds the first useful job:
``HealthTickJob`` (heartbeat scope, stale sweep, transition-only audit)
plus an exception-safe wrapper (``_run_safely``) so an exception in
the tick never kills the schedule slot.

B4 added a second job (``ReliabilityRecheckJob``) + an
``on_error=`` parameter on ``_run_safely`` so the reliability job's
isolated error policy lives in the job (not in the scheduler
wrapper). The ``HealthTickJob`` keeps the B3b default
(``session-scheduler`` flips to ``ERROR``).

B5 adds a third job (``IngestionCycleJob``) — an **async**
coroutine, registered with a **new async wrapper
``_arun_safely``** (NOT the sync ``_run_safely``, which would
silently never await the coroutine — Emma's fragment D mandatory
code fix). Both wrappers share a common error-policy helper
``_handle_job_error`` so the B3b default / B4-on-error / B5-isolated
behaviours live in one place.

Design constraints (carry-forward from B0 / A6 / B1):

* **Explicit constructor DI.** Dependencies (``settings``, ``registry``,
  ``health_monitor``, ``audit_writer``, ``event_bus``) are passed by
  keyword argument. ``ClayScheduler`` never imports ``clay.bootstrap``
  — the A6 lesson holds: production wiring is the same wiring as the
  test wiring; tests construct ``ClayScheduler`` with the dependencies
  they want to observe.

* **ThreadPoolExecutor for sync work.** ``AsyncIOScheduler``'s default
  executor is the asyncio loop — synchronous DB or file I/O in a job
  would block the loop and freeze request handlers. We override with a
  ``concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)`` and route
  **sync** jobs through ``executor="default"`` (B0 §11.1 mitigation).
  Async jobs (``IngestionCycleJob``) are registered with the default
  executor (the asyncio loop itself) — this is the explicit
  ``async def`` registered-callable contract that determines
  APScheduler routing.

* **Single-worker assumption.** This scheduler runs **in-process**.
  Multi-worker deployments (e.g. uvicorn ``--workers N``) would start
  ``N`` schedulers; the operator must run Clay single-worker or accept
  that background jobs run multiple times. Out of scope for Wave B
  (would need leader-election).

* **Real ``session-scheduler`` status.** Pre-B3 the registry
  hard-stamped ``HEALTHY`` at import time (fake). After B3a the
  scheduler moves through ``STOPPED → HEALTHY → STOPPING → STOPPED``
  in lockstep with the underlying ``AsyncIOScheduler`` lifecycle, and
  B3b will add ``ERROR`` for tick exceptions and ``STALE`` for missed
  health ticks.

        ``ERROR → ERROR`` (anti-flood) and turn repeated
        failures into ``HEALTHY → ERROR → HEALTHY → ERROR``
        pseudo-transitions that flood the audit log.
