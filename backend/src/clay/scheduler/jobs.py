"""Scheduled jobs for ``ClayScheduler``.

B3b: the first useful scheduler job — ``HealthTickJob``.

Each tick:

1. Snapshots the current statuses of all services (``before``).
2. Heartbeats **only** ``session-scheduler`` (proof the loop is alive).
3. Re-asserts ``session-scheduler`` as ``HEALTHY`` — in steady state this
   is a no-op, but it is the recovery path from ``ERROR`` (when a
   previous tick raised). The diff-then-audit step (6) catches the
   ``ERROR → HEALTHY`` transition and audits it like any other
   transition.
4. Runs ``HealthMonitor.refresh()`` — the ``None``-guard on
   ``last_heartbeat_at`` already exempts services that don't heartbeat
   themselves (so this can't false-positive ``STALE`` on services whose
   ``last_heartbeat_at`` is still ``None``).
5. Publishes ``health.tick`` to ``event_bus`` (live observability;
   **not** written to audit to keep ``audit.jsonl`` from being flooded
   with per-tick noise).
6. Diffs ``before`` → ``after``; for every service whose status
   changed, writes ``service.status_changed`` to audit **and**
   publishes the same event on the bus.

Heartbeat-scope is **only** ``session-scheduler`` by design (Emma fix,
captured in ``.context/handoffs/current.md`` §41-50 of Wave B): a tick
that heartbeats every registered service would defeat
``HealthMonitor.refresh()``'s stale-detection by always keeping
``last_heartbeat_at = now`` for everyone — the refresh's
``now - last_heartbeat_at`` comparison would always come out
``≈ 0 < stale_after``, and **no service would ever be flagged
``STALE``**.

The self-heartbeating tick is **itself** incapable of detecting its
own death (if the tick thread hangs, no new ``last_heartbeat_at``
will be written, but there is no external reader doing the
comparison). That is an **out-of-scope v1 limitation**; an external
watchdog is the proper mitigation and is left for a future slice.

B4: the second job — ``ReliabilityRecheckJob``. Scheduler-driven
reliability recheck with **transition-only** audit/bus emission
(B3b anti-flood pattern) and an **isolated error policy** (a
reliability-recheck exception is **not** propagated to
``session-scheduler`` — it lives in this job's own
``_failing`` flag and ``reliability.recheck_failed`` audit).

B5: the third job — ``IngestionCycleJob``. Async coroutine
registered with ``ClayScheduler._arun_safely`` (NOT ``_run_safely``
— sync wrapper would never await ``run()``'s coroutine, silent
no-op; Emma's fragment D mandatory code fix). The 2-tuple
``(incidents_present, freshness_state_transitions)`` is the
**transition signal** the job diffs; the B4 anti-flood /
first-run / ``_failing`` reset / isolated-error pattern carries
over verbatim.

    Each tick:

    1. Opens a transient ``Session`` from ``session_factory`` (the
       scheduler-owned factory; the job owns the session lifecycle so
       the operator-trusted ``last_rechecked_at`` write-through
       happens even when the service is not in a real request
       handler).
    2. Calls ``reliability_service.recheck(session, emit=False)`` —
       ``emit=False`` skips the A6 audit/bus emission (the B4 plan
       ratified Option B from
       ``obs-2026-06-02-002-b4-recon-side-effect-concern.md``);
       ``recheck`` still persists ``last_rechecked_at`` in-memory
       and in the DB, so the A5 contract holds.
    3. Commits the session (so the durable write survives
       ``apscheduler`` crashes mid-tick) and **resets the
       ``_failing`` episode** — a successful run closes the
       failing episode so the next failure re-emits the audit
       (Emma's mandatory fix from the B4 ratification).
    4. Computes the new state tuple ``(release_readiness_status,
       blocking_gate_count, warning_gate_count)``. If ``_cache`` is
       ``None`` (first run after process start), **seed it and
       return** — no audit, no bus, the operator does not need to
       know the job came up.
    5. If the new state equals the cached state, **return** — a
       steady state emits nothing (B3b anti-flood pattern).
    6. If the new state differs, **invoke
       ``reliability_service.emit_recheck_events(snapshot)``** (the
       public method that owns the audit + bus payload shape) and
       update ``_cache``.

    Error policy (isolated from ``HealthTickJob`` — B4 (a)):

    The job is registered with APScheduler ``kwargs={"on_error":
    job.on_error}`` so ``ClayScheduler._run_safely`` invokes
    ``on_error(exc)`` on the first raised exception per failing
    episode (B3b-style anti-flood). The reliability job's error
    policy is **isolated**: it does not flip ``session-scheduler``
    to ``ERROR`` and does not write ``service.status_changed`` —
    it writes ``reliability.recheck_failed`` (the dedicated
    verb) and sets a transient ``_failing`` flag. The flag is
    **reset on the next successful ``run()``** (step 3), so a
    new failing episode re-emits the audit. Without the reset,
    a second failing episode would be silently swallowed (the
    bug Emma caught at ratification — see

    1. Checks ``service.is_running`` — if ``True`` (a manual
