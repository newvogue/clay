# These are the *only* states a restored ``session_state`` row can map
# to (see ``SessionControlService.reconcile_runtime_state``):
# - ACTIVE_SESSION: a session was running before restart (``paused_at IS NULL``);
# - PAUSED: a session was paused before restart (``paused_at`` set).
# Whitelisting matters: ``reconcile_to`` skips ``validate_transition`` and
# ``_assert_critical_services_ready`` (reconcile = fact, not request), so we
# must not let it become a back-door setter for arbitrary states (e.g.
# BACKGROUND_MONITORING, REVIEW, DEGRADED — those have no "restored" analogue).

        source-of-truth (e.g. ``session_state.session_id`` + ``paused_at``).

        **Boot-safety by design:** unlike ``transition_to``, this method
        does NOT call ``validate_transition`` (no path validation) and
        does NOT call ``_assert_critical_services_ready`` (no readiness
        gate). The argument is that a reconciled state is a *fact* — we
        just read it from the DB on startup — not a *request* to change
        mode. A healthy system must be able to come back up with a
        previously-active session even if the control-api service has
        not yet reported HEALTHY (A6: closing the post-restart
        ``lifecycle_state="review"`` trap from A4 §6 Q2).

        **Whitelist guard:** only ``ACTIVE_SESSION`` and ``PAUSED`` are
        valid reconcile targets. These are the two states a restored
        ``_active_session`` can project to. ``BACKGROUND_MONITORING``
        (no session restored) and ``REVIEW`` (post-complete) are NOT
        restored — they are reached via ``transition_to`` (operator
        action) or by leaving the manager at its default. ``DEGRADED``
        is reached via ``enter_degraded`` (service health axis — a
        separate concern owned by the runtime-health monitor in
        Wave B / ADR-007; this method never touches it).

        The whitelist is what keeps the relaxed validation honest: we
        skip path/readiness checks (reconcile is a fact, not a request)
        but we still validate that the target is *reconcile-valid*
        (you cannot use this to set ``DEGRADED`` or ``BACKGROUND_MONITORING``).
