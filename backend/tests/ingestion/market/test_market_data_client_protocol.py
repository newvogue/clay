"""Tests for ``MarketDataClient`` Protocol conformance (E1).

The Protocol is the exchange-agnostic contract — every exchange
adapter must conform structurally (duck-typed). These tests pin
the conformance for ``BinanceSpotClient`` and verify the runtime
type-checker accepts it via ``runtime_checkable``.

Why ``runtime_checkable`` is enough for E1:

* ``isinstance(client, MarketDataClient)`` lets us assert the
  structural contract at module import time (cheap contract pin).
* The Protocol itself is the source of truth for pyright/mypy
  static checks.
* A second exchange (Bybit, E4) will get the same conformance
  test — the test file is the seam for that future addition.
