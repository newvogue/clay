"""Regression tests for the demo signal seed harness.

Hermetic SQLite (via the project's ``db_session`` fixture). Each
test gets a fresh DB. The two tests prove the seam from G5b:

* ``seed`` produces a signal with ``state in {"active", "weakening"}``
  and ``ranking_score >= 0.45`` on the real signal_engine pipeline.
* ``seed`` is idempotent (re-running does not drift the score) and
  ``clean`` removes the seeded rows so the signal disappears.
