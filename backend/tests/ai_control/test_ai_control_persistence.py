"""Persistence tests for ``AIControlService``.

These tests exercise the Slice A3 contract:

- **First-boot:** an empty DB is seeded with ``INITIAL_ASSIGNMENTS``
  (4 rows in ``ai_assignments``) on the first ``AIControlService``
  construction.
- **Restart-survival:** an ``AIControlService`` constructed against a
  DB that has prior writes (apply / review) restores the persisted
  ``assignments`` and pending-review state instead of using defaults.
- **Write-through:** ``review_assignment`` and ``apply_assignment``
  commit their changes through the supplied ``Session``; the service's
  in-memory state stays consistent with what is on disk.

The repository layer is bypassed for some direct DB asserts (``select``
+ ``func.count()``) to keep the test honest about what was actually
written, not just what the service claims it wrote.
