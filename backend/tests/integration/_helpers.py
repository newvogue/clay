"""Shared helpers for the A6 integration suite.

These helpers deliberately exercise the **production** ``build_services``
factory (not a parallel hand-rolled bundle). The whole point of A6 is
that the integration suite catches bootstrap regressions like the
double-init bug discovered during A6 recon — a parallel bundle
construction would test a different universe and miss exactly the
class of bug the suite is meant to catch.

The file-based SQLite path follows the existing conftest pattern
(``tmp_path / "clay-restart.db"``) so a real ``session_factory`` is
threaded through every persisted service. ``XdgPaths`` is rooted at
``tmp_path`` so ``AuditWriter`` and config files do not leak into
the developer's home directory.
