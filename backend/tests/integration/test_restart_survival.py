"""A6 integration suite: end-to-end restart survival over the 6
persisted ops tables, plus ``runtime_manager`` reconciliation.

These tests run against the **production** ``build_services`` factory
on a file-based SQLite (A1-decisions). They catch bootstrap regressions
like the A6 double-init bug, where the second pass of services
silently dropped the ``session_factory`` in production while every
A3-A5 unit test still passed.

Coverage map:

- ``test_full_restart_survives_all_six_persisted_areas`` — every
  persisted area is mutated, the process is "restarted" by building a
  fresh service graph on the same DB, and every area is asserted
  restored. Includes ``ai_control_state.last_reviewed_at`` and
  ``pending_review_*`` (the operator-path side-effects of
  ``apply_assignment``, beyond the ``ai_assignments`` upsert).

- ``test_runtime_state_reconciled_to_active_session_after_restart`` —
  start a session, restart, ``runtime_manager.state ==
  ACTIVE_SESSION`` and ``lifecycle_state == "active_session"`` (not
  the false-positive ``"review"`` from the BACKGROUND_MONITORING +
  ``_active_session is not None`` fallthrough in ``_build_lifecycle``).

- ``test_runtime_state_reconciled_to_paused_session_after_restart`` —
  start + pause, restart, ``runtime_manager.state == PAUSED`` and
  ``lifecycle_state == "paused"``.

- ``test_reconcile_boot_safe_when_critical_services_not_ready`` —
  ``reconcile_to`` does NOT call ``_assert_critical_services_ready``:
  even with ``control-api = NOT_READY``, the post-restart reconcile
  is a no-exception fact, not a request. Closes the boot-safety
  concern Emma raised in A6.

The existing 5 ``test_alpha_readiness_service`` tests stay in-memory
**by design** (``build_alpha_bundle`` constructs a parallel service
graph with no ``session_factory``). This is intentional divergence —
those tests exercise the alpha-readiness logic with a fast in-memory
fixture and are not meant to be a restart-survival substitute. The
integration suite is the persistent-wiring smoke test.
