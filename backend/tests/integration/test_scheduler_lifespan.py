"""B6 integration tests — lifespan + scheduler (lifecycle + jobs + audit + bus).

Builds the full service graph via ``build_services_for_integration(tmp_path)``
(real factory + real ``ClayScheduler`` + real jobs, file-based SQLite in
``tmp_path``, isolated ``AuditWriter`` in ``tmp_path/state``), monkeypatches
the ``clay.api.lifespan`` module-level deps to point at the isolated
services (because ``lifespan`` resolves them as module-level imports from
``clay.bootstrap``, and FastAPI ``dependency_overrides`` does NOT intercept
module-level names), and drives the FastAPI app through
``asgi_lifespan.LifespanManager``.

Covers 13 scenarios from the B6 task-packet (Standard+5, plus the
routing-matrix test that confirms Emma's B5 fragment D fix on the
integration level). The existing two tests in ``tests/api/test_lifespan.py``
stay on the production app — they verify module-level wiring against the
real ``clay.bootstrap`` singletons, which is itself a useful smoke test.
This file uses real scheduler + real jobs + isolated DB + isolated audit.
