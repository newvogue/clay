"""Tests for the B5 ``POST /ingestion/run`` route — 409 when busy.

The route contract is unchanged for the happy path: the manual
``run_once(session, emit=True)`` call writes audit + bus, returns
the summary payload. The new contract adds **409 Conflict** when
the ``asyncio.Lock`` is held — the operator-facing equivalent of
the scheduler-job's quiet ``skip + log`` path.
