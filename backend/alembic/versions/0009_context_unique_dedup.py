"""add context dedup unique constraints

Revision ID: 0009_context_unique_dedup
Revises: 0008_ops_runtime_state
Create Date: 2026-06-03 12:00:00.000000

Adds DB-level UniqueConstraint on (source_name, headline, published_at) for
context.news_items and (source_name, symbol, captured_at) for
context.sentiment_snapshots. This is defense-in-depth on top of the
app-level SELECT-skip dedup in ContextRepository — closing the TOCTOU
window between SELECT and INSERT under multi-worker or restart races.

The defensive dedup-cleanup step (DELETE ... USING ...) runs FIRST so the
ADD CONSTRAINT succeeds even if duplicates already exist. It is idempotent
(no-op on a clean DB) and PG-specific by design — migrations are not
exercised on SQLite per the A1 test policy.
